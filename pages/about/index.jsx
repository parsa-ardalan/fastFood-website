                Considering the increase of price, or inconsistant status of the items, One of the popular features that is available for consumers
                is to use the menu part. This feature avoids others using paper menu.
                So, instead of using a menu, everyone could have it on their phone. This could be meant mutual for both sides consumers and staff.
                We tend to update the menu part day by day cause of you being comportable.

                This website is devoted to the FastFood chain resturant located in The United States of America. But we are planning on having
                more branches in varid locations, other countries and cities. However, at first, we were donated around 1,000,000 dollars by a domanent
                benefactor who recommanded that we dedicate our career to homeless and orphan children. So this step was our first opportunity to get
                better and conduct different related tasks.

                launch more serieces and make the family more extended.
